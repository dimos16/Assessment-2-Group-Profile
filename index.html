    Background, Hobbies, IT Interest, and IT Experience:<br>
    <p>My education tis acquiring my Cert III in Information, Digital, Media and Technology, which I got through my IT Traineeship. In my spare time I enjoy producing music on my MacBook (Ableton is the DAW I use), working on my fitness and sometimes a bit of gaming. My favourite sport is Soccer, and I play in a futsal team once a week. Present, my main interest in IT is in the Cyber Security field. The aspect of being in the mind of the attackers to prevent what they are doing fascinates me. My interest in IT all strands from my passion of technology, where from a young age I would dismantle old or broken technology (Computers, Stereos, DVD Players etc.) When I was 11 years old, an event that really sparked my growing interest for IT was when I successfully installed a “RGH” (Reset Glitch Hack) on my Xbox 360. The process of performing this “mod/hack” includes, soldering mod chips onto the console’s motherboard, which allows you to flash the nand and install custom firmware. From that day, my interest and passion for IT has only grown greater.</p><br><br>

    The most challenging thing part about a Cybersecurity role is the increasing number of bad guys distributing malware and infiltrating networks. With these attacks becoming more sophisticated, the cyber analysts must always try to be one step ahead of the breachers, by keeping as up to date as possible on the latest threats and exploits.<br><br><br>
